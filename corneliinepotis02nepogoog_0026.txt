books, seems to have been the chief »authority for the lives of
Hamilcar and Hannibal, although Nepos does not always agree ·
with him. Sosilas and Silenus, who served in Hannibal’s army
and wrote an account of the second Punic war, are cited by '
Nepos ;¹ also Sulpicius Blitho, who is known to us only by
name.

In some of his lives Nepos makes statements which are not
supported by any os our authorities, and must have been
derived from some unknown source. In his life ol Epami-
nondas,² he says that ‘very many writers' wrote biographies of
illustrious men, and these he very probably had before him.
Of such writers we know os Anagonus Carystius, Hermippus
tae Pm'patetic, and Satyrus among the Greeks, and Marcus
Ter vatius Varro and Santra among the Romans.

T wo well· known writers of later times to some extent
described the same events, and used the same sources as
Nepos. These are Diodorus Siculas, who in the time of
Augustus wrote a UnzaersalHistary in forty books ; and Plu-
tarch (46-120 nn), from whom we have forty-six Parallel
Lt'aes of illustrious Greeks and Romans. With these writers
Nepos is frequently in conflict, although sometimes he agrees
with them against the testimony of the earlier authorities.
