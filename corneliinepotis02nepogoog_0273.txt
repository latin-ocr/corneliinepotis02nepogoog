After King Darius had made war on the Scythians, and had
been unsuccessful,l he was urged by his friends to reduce Greece
under his power. Accordingly he built a fleet, of which Datis
and Artaphemes were given the command,2 and sent it against
the Athenians. They went first to Eretria, which they captured,
and then to Attica, where they encamped in the plain of Mara· =
thon, which is about ten miles from the city. The Athenians
sent to Lacedaemon to ask for aid, and also elected ten generals
at home, one of whom was Miltiades.

It is said that there was a dispute among the generals,
whether to go to meet the enemy or to remain³ in the city,
but that Miltiades persuaded them to light.4 He drew up his
troops at the foot of a mountain, together with a thousand
Plataean soldiers who had come to the aid⁵ os the Athenians
The Persians attacked them, but were utterly defeated.

11. THEMISTOCLES.

r. Nepos says that few are considered equal to Themistocles
in ability. 2. It happened⁶ that Themistocles so neglected his
property that he was disinherited by his father. 3. He thought
that he must devote⁷ himself wholly to his country, in order to
blot out the disgrace. 4. Thucydides tells us that Themis-
tocles judged present events very sagaciously, and formed con-
jectures about future events very clearly.

5. Themistocles will be made general by the people, to carry
on the war with Corcyra. 6. Let us persuade the people to
build a lieet with the money which comes from the mines.
7. When Themistocles had persuaded the Athenians to build a
fleet, they became so skilled in naval war that they crushed the
Corcyreans. 8. The report was brought to Athens that Xerxes
was going to make war on all Europe both by land and by sea.
