INTRODUCHON

Cui dono lepidum novum libellum
Arido modo pumice expolitum?
Corneli, tibi; namque tu solebas
Meas esse aliquid putate nugas,

Iam tum cum ausus es unus italorum
Omne aevum tribus explicate chartis,
Doctis, Iuppiter, et laboriosis!
Quare habe tibi quidquid hoc libelli
Qualecumque, quod, ο patrona virgo,
Plus uno maneat perenne saeclo.l

It is believed by some, from a reference of Fronto, that
NepoS, like his friend Atticus, was a publisher as well as a
writer.

ii. Tim Wonns or Nepos.

Nepos was a prolific writer in several different departments

of literature. Most of his works have been lost and are
known to us only through references to them by other writers
They included the following z -

1. Love poems, mentioned by the younger Pliny in the
letter cited above.

lTranslated as follows by Robinson Ellis, 'The Poems and Fragments of
Catullus, Translated in the Metres of the Original' London, 1871 : -—

Who shall take thee, the new, the dainty volume,
Purfled glossily, fresh with ashy pumice?

You, Cornelius; you of old did hold them
Something worthy, the petty witty nothings,

While you venture, alone of all Italians,
T ime's vast chronicle in three books to circle,
Jove, how arduous, bow divinely learned!

Therefore welcome it, yours the little outcast,
This slight volume. Ο yet, supreme awarder,
Virgin, save it in ages on forever.
