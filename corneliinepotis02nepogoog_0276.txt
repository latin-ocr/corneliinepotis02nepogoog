to Argos to live, he was accused in his absence by the Lacedae-
moniam, who allegedl that he had made a league with the king

of Persia to overthrow Greece. 39. The chief men of Corcyra
said that they were afraid that the Lacedaemonians and Atheni-
ans would make war on them because they had received Themis·
tocles. 40. In order that the king of the Molossians might
protect him, Themistocles is said to have taken the king's little
son and to have fled into a shrine. He said that he would not
corne out of the shrine until the king received² him under his
protection. 41. “If Ι am carried by the storm to Naxos,’'
said Themistocles, “I must perish, since the army of the
Athenians is there.'' 42. Themistocles told the master of the
ship who he was, and said that he would give him many gifts
if he would save him. 43. When the master of the ship was
seized with pity and had taken Themistocles to Ephesus, the
latter said that afterwards he would requitc8 him for his service.

44. Although many have written that Themistocles went
to Asia when Xerxes was king, 'Nepos 'says that he believes
Thucydides when he says that Themistocles went to Artaxerxes
45. Themistocles, in the letter which he wrote to King Artaxerxes,
said that although he had inflicted very many injuries on the
Pessinos, he would be a good friend of the king is he should
obtain his friendship. 46. Themistocles said that he had
informed Xerxes by a letter that the Greeks were going to
destroy the bridge which the king had made over the Helles-
pont. 47. The king said that he would pardon Themistocles,
because he admired his high spirit.⁴ 48. After Themistocles
had given the space of a year to the literature and language ol
the Persians‚ he was able to speak more elegantly than the
native Persians. 49. The king said: “l will give you three
cities, - Magnesia to furnish you with bread, Lampsacus from
which you may get wine, and Myus to supply you with dainties.”
