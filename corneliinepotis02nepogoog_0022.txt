one of Livy. As Asinius Pollio found a certain ‘Patavinity’

in the language of Livy, who was, like Nepos, a native os
Cisalpine Gaul, it is possible that some os the stylistic peculiar-
ities os our author may be due to his provincial origin.

The deviations os Nepos from classical usage have been
unduly exaggerated by those who have endeavored to prove
that Probus was the author os the Lives. Many of his irregu-
larities may be paralleled in Caesar 3ηά Cicero, and still more
in Livy. As Nipperdey says, we must remember that Caesar
and Cicero represent the highest literary perfection of their
time 3 a period which includes Varro, and the writers of the
Bellum Africanum 3ηά Bellum Hispaniense, also has room ior
astylist like Cornelius Nepos. His Latin is pure enough to
prove beyond question that the Lives could have been written
only in the Classical Period.

Since it is desirable that beginners in Latin writing use only
regular constructions‚ the important deviations of Nepos from·
good classical usage are pointed out in the Norss. The
teacher should cons'ult the exhaustive monograph of Lupus,
Der Spraclzgebrauclz des Cornelius Nepos, Berlin, 1876.

As history the work os Nepos is not oi great value. His
list oi generals is not remarkably well chosen, for we miss
some greatnames, such as Brasidas, Aratos, Philopoemen, and
Cleomenes 3 and the space allotted to each is by no means
proportionate to the importance os the subjectos the biog-
raphy. Nepos is inclined to exaggeration, and he lacks the
critical faculty. It has been said that his work does more
credit to his heart than to his head, and this is notably the
case in his biography of his friend Atticus
