For his lives of generals of foreign nations he had an abun-
dance of good authorities at his command, many of whom he
mentions by name ; but he seems not always to have chosen
wisely among them, and sometimes to have misunderstood
them. He is careless iu details: his chronology is confused,
he makes mistakes in history and geography, and his work is
marred by contradictious and omissions. On the other hand,
he touches on most points of interest in Grecian history, and
for that reason, as well as on account of their simple style,
the Lives are well adapted for use as a school text-book.
Some allowance should be made for his shortcomings ln view
of the fact, thatin his day the Romans were just beginning
to cultivate the writing of history as an art ; and because he
was the first Roman writer to treat the history of foreign
nations.

1. Herodotus, the ‘father of history’ (about 484 to 4²5 ne).
His History gives an account of the struggle between the
Greeks and Persians, with numerous digressions in which the
history of other nations is treated. The work was divided by
some one of the grammarians into nine books, to which the
names of the nine Muses were given. Nepos does not men·
tion Herodotus, and although he sometimes agrees with the
Iulium, it is by no means certain that he consulted it at all.
In his life of Miltiades he is at variance with Herodotus in
several details.

2. Thucydides (about 45 5 to 400 ne.) undertook a Hz'story
of tlte Peloponnest'an War, of which eight books, describing
the course of events until 411 nc, were completed. Nepos
