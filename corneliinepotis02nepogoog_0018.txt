i. Lus os Nauos.

Communis Nepos was born in Cisalpine Gaul, the native
country os Catullus, Vergil, and Livy. The elder Plinyl speaks
os him as Padi accola ,· and since we know that he was a
native of that part os Cisalpine Gaul which was called Insu-

his birthplace was Ticinum, the modern Pavia.

The dates of his birth and death are not certainly known,
but he appears to have lived from 99 to 24 ne. We know
that he survived Atticm, who died in 32 B.c., and that he lived
to a good old age. His praenbmen is unknown.

Nepos took up his residence at Rome early in lise. He
seems to have had an independent fortune and to have
devoted his whole attention to literary pursuits. He took no
part in politics; at least, we know hom one of Pliny’s letters²
that he was notos senatorial rank, and therefore that he had
not held even a quaestorship.

He was on terms of intimacy with Cicer0, Atticus, and
Catullus, Catullus dedicated his book of poems to Nepos in
the following complimentary lines : ³—
