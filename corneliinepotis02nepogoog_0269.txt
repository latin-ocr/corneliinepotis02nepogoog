EXERCISES FOR TRANSLATION INTO
LATIN.

In the following exercises no attempt has been made to prepare a series
ol graded lessons in Latin syntax, but merely to illustrate the language and
constructions ol the text on which they are based.

The sentences are intended lor rapid oral work, to increase the pupil's
vocabulary, to train him in expressing himself fluently in Latin, and to cultivate
the habit ol carelully noting the meaning oi all the Latin words while reading.
The continuous passages may be written or recited orally. lt is strongly
recommended that when they are written the pupil mark the quantity ol all the
long vowels.

References like this, p. 6, l. 14, are to the pages and lines of the Text; they
refer sometimes to the meaning and sometimes to the construction, and should
be used carelully. Words between parentheses are to be omitted in translating
into Latin.
