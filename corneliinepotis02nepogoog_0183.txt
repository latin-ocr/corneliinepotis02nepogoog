great many cases of the perf. subj. in a result clause after a past
tense. See B. 268,6; A. 287,c; G. 5133 H. 495, vr. ln this
socalled exception to the rule of the ‘sequence of the tenses} the
verb of the result clause is independent so far as its tense is con·
cemed. When the imp. subj. is used, the result is more closely
connected with the time represented by the main verb.

Pege ’1. 1. petierint: see note on profligarint, p. 6,l. 32.
2. adhuc: i.e. up to the writer's own time. nobilius: ‘more
famous' Note the derivation3 see Vocab. nulla enim um·
quam tam exigua manus: ‘for never did so small aforce.' ln
Eng. we transfer the negative to the adv. 3. opes: ‘power,'
including men, ships, money, and resources of all kinds

VI. 4. Cuius victoriae: ‘for this victory,' gen. modifying
praemium. Note the order, which is involved but natural. Read
the sentence carefully through in tlte Latin order, noting the end-
ings of the words and their relation to one another. alienum:
‘out of place,' i.e. foreign t0 the subject. 5. quo: ‘in order
that) Why is quo used rather than ut? 6. eandem: predi-
cate adj ., emphatic position. 7. quondam: ‘in former times)
8. effnsl: ‘lavish,' contrasted with both νᾶνῑ and tenues, while
obsoleti, ‘worthless,'· lit. ‘worn out‚' is contrasted with gloriosi.
11. liberarat: :liberaverat tilis honos tributus est, etc:
note the order; cf. ¹note tol. 4, above. talis hunos is explained by
the clause ut . . . committerem the clause cum . . . depingeretur,
which modifies the ut clause, is put before it, instead of being in·
cluded within it, an order of which Nepos is rather fond. talis =
ln'c, as is frequently the case in Nepos. The special honor was
that Miltiades was represented as foremost among the ten generals
encouraging the soldiers and directing the battle. 15. largitibne
magistratuum: it is not clear to what Nepos refers. He probably

speaks generally, and with some confusion of Greek and Roman
conditione.

v11. 21. pleraeque: sc. z'nsulds. 22. Parum: see map ol
Greece in the front of the book, G. 4. opibus elatam: ‘full of
confidence in its strength'3 for the meaning of opibus see l. 3,
above. Parum: object ol reconciliare. The position of cum is
not unusual, cf. l. 12, above. 24. vineis¹ ac testudinibus:
