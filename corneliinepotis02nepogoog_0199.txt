form with erat. populum urbenum: the citizens, as distin-
guished from exercitum. 25. Primum: ‘ln the first place?
imperator: ‘as general) 26. Amphipolim constituit: Nepos
is in error here. Amphipolis was founded in 437 nc. by Agnon.
Two unsuccessful attempts had previously been made, neither under
Cimon’s leadership. 27. idem: ‘he also'

Pege 24. 1. iterum imperator: ⁴ (appointed) generalior
the second time' iterum is not parallel to Primum, but modifies
imperatam· the correlative to Primum, which would be deinde, is
implied in Idem. Mycalen: another error. The battle at
at Mycale was fought in 479 B.c., and the leaders were Leotychides
and Xanthippus. The connection shows that Nepos refers to the
battle fought off the mouth of the river Eurymedon, in Pamphylia,
in 469 nc. 2. devictam: trans. by a finite verb3 note the force
of ἀεὶ. 7. acerbitatem imperit: sc. Atheniensium. For the

their power, and many ol the islands revolted. 8. bene anime-
tes . . . alienates: trans. by rel. clauses. oenfirmevit: sc.

sue aduente: ‘immediately on his arrival‚’—an exaggeration,
since the revolt of Thasos lasted two years (464-463 nc). Hes

13. arx: ‘the Acropolis' que ad meridiem vergit: ‘on the
south side! 14. est erneta: here = cst mnnita3 the reference is

111. 15. enus . . mexime: see note on nnus onmium strennue,
