TRANSLATION INTO LATIN 243

to his country, they are said to have sent ambassadors to him
to order him to return home. ,

When Pausanias had returned to Sparta, the Lacedaemonians
feared that he would stir up the Helots, who persorm the ser·
vice of slaves among the Lacedaemoniam, by promising them
that he would give them liberty 3 but although, according to
the laws of Sparta, any ephor might throw the king into prison,
they did not wish to arrest Pausanias until they had clearl
proof. Now there wasa youth srom Argilus, to whom Pausa·
nias had given a letter lor Artabazus. He suspected that Pau-
sanias had written something about him, because no one of
those who had carried letters from Pausanias to Artabazus had
ever returned. So he opened² the letter and found that
Pausanias had ordered that he be killed. So the youth fled
to the shrine ¹of Neptune at Taenarum,³ and sat on the altar as
a suppliant of the god. Pausanias came to the same place,
and asked the Argilian why he had done this. The youth
replied that he had found out that if he delivered the letter

to Artabazus, he must die. When Pausanias begged him not ,

to tell what he had learned, the ephorS, who were in a place
under ground near the temple os Neptune, heard what was
said, and retumed to Sparta with Pausanias, in order to arrest
him in the city. But Pausanias is said to have guessed⁴ from
the sace of one of the ephors that he was going to be arrested,
and to have fled into the temple os Minerva. The ephors
ordered the doors of the temple to be blocked up, and the
roos to be destroyed, aud his own mother is said to have
brought the first stone. Pausanias died near the temple, aster
he had been carried out hals dead, and was buried not sar off.
