2. Chronica, referred to by Catullus in his dedication to
Nepos. This work comprised in three books an outline of
the world's history from the earliest times until the author’s
own day. It was probably, like the Annalis of AtticuS,¹ of a
chronological character.

3. Exempla, amoral treatise in at least five books,² draw-
ing a comparison between the manners and customs of early
Rome and those of his own day.

4. A Laje of Cato, mentioned by Nepos himself.8

5. Α Life of Cicero, a panegyric, apparently composed after
the death of the orator. .

6. Α Treatzre on Geograplzy, of which little or nothing is
known.

7. D? Viris Illr'cstrz'bur, his last and greatest work. This
consisted of, at least, sixteen books. He arranged his biog-
raphies in classes or groups, giving two books to each class.
'Ibe first book of every class included the distinguished men
of foreign nations, mostly of Greece; while the second treated

those of Rome. The following outline of Nipperdey, though
open to question in some particulars, gives a good idea of the
scope and arrangement of the work : —

Ι. ΒΞ Rigibus Exterairum Gentium.
ΙΙ. D? Rigibur Romanorum.
ΙΙΙ. ΒΞ Excellentibus Ducibus Exterdrum Gentium.
lv. Di Excellentibus Ducibus Romdnorum.
V. Di Iuris Consultis Graecis.
VI. DZ Iuris Cdnsultis Romunis.
VII. D? Oratoribus Graecia
v111. οε Oritbribus numanis.
